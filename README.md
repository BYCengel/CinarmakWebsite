# CinarmakWebsite
An e-commerce website I'm currently developing. (Work in Progress)

This project is being developed using ASP.NET CORE 6, HTML / CSS (Bootstrap) / JS and EF Core as ORM.

Currently Includes:

- A database for Products, Categories, Users and Roles using ORM which enables implementation for various DBMS's without creating big workloads.
- Data layer for all kinds of functions for database interactions using EF Core ORM.
- Business layer for implementing business logic independently. (for modularity)
- Entity layer for database table implementations.
- Seed data for testing.
- Basic popularity logic using view counts and some randomization for products and categories.
- Scalable and free admin interaction with products and categories.
- UI for customers.
- UI for admins.
- User functions like login, register and logout.
And many other features.

This project is still work in progress.
